\begin{abstract}
The high cost of proprietary Big Data infrastructure and software licenses presents a significant barrier to entry for academic research and small organizations. This paper presents a cost-effective, open-source Data Lake solution deployed on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Free Tier. The methodology leverages an architecture of ARM compute instances, orchestrated by Apache Ambari within the Open Source Data Platform (ODP) stack. The proposed architecture establishes a complete data pipeline, enabling data ingestion via Apache NiFi and Kafka, distributed storage with HDFS, and processing using Apache Spark and Hive. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the OCI Free Tier provides sufficient resources to support a functional, multi-node Hadoop cluster capable of handling moderate workloads. The results validate the viability of this model as a reproducible, low-cost platform for democratizing access to Big Data technologies in educational and research environments. \bnote{Garantir que o abstract reflita quantitativamente os resultados de performance do capítulo 5 antes da submissão.}
